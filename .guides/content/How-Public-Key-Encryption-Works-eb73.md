## Advantages and Disadvantages
Because users share only a public key used for encryption, keeping key distribution safe and a secret is not an issue. Public keys can be broadly shared over non-secure channels and used by others to encrypt messages for the key's creator. Only the key's creator has the private key that can be used to decrypt messages encrypted with their public key.

Public key encryption is significantly more computationally expensive, and it requires more storage than symmetric key encryption. This is typically an acceptable trade-off today, given high-speed computer processing and the importance of confidentiality.
