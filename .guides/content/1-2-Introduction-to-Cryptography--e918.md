>**Young Alan Turing:** What's that you're reading?
**Christopher Morcom:** It's about cryptography.
**Young Alan Turing:** Like secret messages?
**Christopher Morcom:** Not secret. That's the brilliant part. Messages that anyone can see but no one knows what they mean, unless you have the key.
**Young Alan Turing:** How's that different from talking?
**Christopher Morcom:** Talking?
**Young Alan Turing:** When people talk to each other, they never say what they mean, they say something else. And you're expected to just know what they mean. Only I never do. So... How's that different?
**Christopher Morcom:** Alan, I have a funny feeling you're going to be very good at this.

During World War II, Alan Turing and his team in British intelligence were able to crack the German Enigma code.  Historians estimate that this shortened the war by two to three years and saved tens of millions of lives. 

In this lesson, you'll learn how to code and decipher messages, first with simple methods, and later, with more complex methods that require increasingly powerful mathematics and computers.

### Instructor's Note
Here's a good cryptography overview video you might share with the class.
