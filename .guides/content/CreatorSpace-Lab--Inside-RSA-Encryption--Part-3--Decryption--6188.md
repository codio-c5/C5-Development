Once you receive your partner's encrypted message, follow these steps to decrypt it.

## Decrypt The Message

- Click the decrypt button below.

{Decrypt}(sh rsa/decrypt.sh lab-part1/private.key lab-part2/cipher.txt lab-part3/partner-message.txt )

Your partner's message should be visible in the panel to the left. (If it is not, then click on the lab-part3/partner-message.txt file in the file tree to the left.)

 - Open the output file and copy and paste the contents into the box below.

{Save!|assessment}(free-text-3356212759)

You can try the process again with other partners.

**Optional:** You can repeat part 2 and encrypt your partner's message using their public key and send the ciphertext to them. They should be able to decrypt their original message using their private key.
