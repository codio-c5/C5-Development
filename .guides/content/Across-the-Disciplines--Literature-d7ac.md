## Frequency Analysis and Literature 
Frequency analysis might fail you if the plaintext is unusual. Consider the case of a novel that does not use the letter E.

The French novel <i>La disparition</i> by Georges Perec was written without using the letter E.  It was later translated into English by Gilbert Adair with the title <i>A Void,</i> which also does not use the letter E. The image on the left shows the English and French book covers, and a sample of the English version of the text.
