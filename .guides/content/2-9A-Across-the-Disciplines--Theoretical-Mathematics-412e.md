>Every prime number [p] divides necessarily one of the powers –1 of any [geometric] progression [a, a2, a3, ...] [that is there exists t such that p divides at – 1], and the exponent of this power [t] divides the given prime –1 [divides p – 1]; and, after one has found the first power [t] that satisfies the question, all those whose exponents are multiple of the exponent of the first one satisfy similarly the question [that is, all multiples of the first t have the same property].


## Paul to describe what the heck this is and why it's relevant....
