**Auguste Kerckhoffs** (1835-1903) - Dutch linguist and cryptographer said:

 ***A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything 
about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.***

Modern encryption algorithms, such as the DES and AES, depend on this principle. These algorithms rely on the strength of the keys that they use. 
The stronger the keys, the harder it is to decode the ciphertext. The algorithms are public and are considered strong only if they survive attempts by cryptanalysts to break them. It's like designing a safe and providing an open invitation to break into it. If it survives, then it is considered a safe safe.

## Security by obscurity
In security engineering, *security through obscurity* (or *security by obscurity*) is the reliance on the secrecy of the design or the implementation of the key as the main method of providing security. 

A system or component that relies on obscurity may have theoretical or actual security vulnerabilities, but its owners or designers believe that if the flaws are not known, that will be sufficient to prevent a successful attack. 

Security experts have rejected this view as far back as 1851, and advise that obscurity should never be the only means of securing a system.
