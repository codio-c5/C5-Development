The Caesar cipher worked well for its time and was often used to communicate battlefield instructions. Back then, computing power was limited to the abacus, which was not useful for breaking codes. All kidding aside, the concept of encryption was virtually unknown, and almost anyone who was literate and who intercepted such messages would have thought they were written in another language. There are no recorded incidents of the Caesar cipher having been broken in ancient times. Simple encryption methods were adequate for that time.

Today, the abacus has given way to powerful, inexpensive computers that could break such a cipher in a microsecond. But computers are unnecessary for the purpose of breaking simple shift ciphers. It can be done with a pencil and paper.

Recall that the Caesar cipher simply shifts each character in a message by a fixed amount. Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet, there are only 26-1 or 25 possible shifts or keys; shifting by 0, "A"->"A" doesn't change the plaintext at all. You can take the first few characters in a ciphertext and shift them by 1, then by 2, and so on until you see a legible word or part of a word.

As computing power increased from abacus to first generation computers, to modern, powerful computers, cryptology has become increasingly complex. Ever more powerful computers are needed to crack increasingly sophisticated cryptographic ciphers. 

The following lessons describe what we use today.
