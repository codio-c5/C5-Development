 What would happen if Bob wasn't really Bob, and Alice wasn't really Alice? So far public key cryptography hasn't addressed this.  Take a second to think about the issue.

**Instructor's Note:** Someone else might have tricked Bob by encrypting messages for Bobâ€™s using his public key and *merely* stated that she is Alice - so far the sender hasn't been required to prove her identity - i.e. anyone who can get Bob's public key (because it's public) can claim to be anyone.  The message is encrypted but it is not clear who the sender is|||
