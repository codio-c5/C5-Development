Simple substitution ciphers offer little more security than shift ciphers do. Polygraphic ciphers provide more security by effectively increasing the key size but ultimately do not provide adaquate encryption.

You can break simple substitution ciphers like shift ciphers by using pen and paper. The polymorphic version is more difficult but will give away its secrets if you use a Crytpanalysis technique called frequency analysis.

If you look at how everyday english is written, you'll see that some letters are used more frequently than others. For instance, the letters "E", "T" and "A" are used much more frequently than "X", "Q" and "Z"


... This means that there is no cost penalty when trying to decrypt a message compared to what is spent encrypting it. Encryption ciphers should be very, very one-sided, meaning that the cost of surrupticiously decrypting a message should be much, much, much more expensive than the cost of encrypting. That requirement is what drives all of today's encryption methods.
