Simple substitution ciphers offer little more security than shift ciphers do. Polygraphic ciphers provide more security by effectively increasing the key size but ultimately do not provide adaquate encryption.

You can break simple substitution ciphers like shift ciphers by using pen and paper. The polymorphic version is more difficult but will give away its secrets if you use a Crytpanalysis technique called frequency analysis.

If you look at how everyday english is written, you'll see that some letters are used more frequently than others. For instance, the letters "E", "T" and "A" are used much more frequently than "X", "Q" and "Z". 

This analysis can be extened to letter groupings like [bigrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram) and [trigrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigram) plus words. It should not be a surprise that words like "the" and "it" occur more frequently than words like "cryptanalyst" 

Knowledge like this helps the Cryptanylst break down cipher text that helps ultimately break cipher text.
