What happens if you sell something online to a stranger, and they say that  they didn't buy it? Digital signatures help prevent non-repudiation.

|||definition
**Non-repudiation** is the ability to ensure that a party cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a  message that they sent.

Digital signatures require the use of a private key known only to the owner. This is referred to as the **signing key.** If a digital signature is verified it is highly unlikely that it came from anyone else. This way, they cannot deny that they were the sender of the message.
