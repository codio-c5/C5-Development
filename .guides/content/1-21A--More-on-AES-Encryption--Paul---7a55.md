Below is a schematic of the AES encryption algorithm. You can see from this that it is rather more rigorous in its approach than the shift and substitution algorithms we have seen so far. AES uses substitution combined with permutation that is referred to as a substitution-permutation network in cryptography. Each block of data is combined

Such a network takes a block of the plaintext and the key as inputs, and applies several alternating "rounds" or "layers" of substitution boxes (S-boxes) and permutation boxes (P-boxes) to produce the ciphertext block. The S-boxes and P-boxes transform (sub-)blocks of input bits into output bits. It is common for these transformations to be operations that are efficient to perform in hardware, such as exclusive or (XOR) and bitwise rotation. The key is introduced in each round, usually in the form of "round keys" derived from it. (In some designs, the S-boxes themselves depend on the key.)
