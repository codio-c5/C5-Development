•If Alice wants to send Bob a confidential message, she gets Bob’s public key.

 

•She encrypts her message to Bob using Bob’s public key and sends it to Bob (possibly over the Internet).

 

•Bob, upon receipt of the encrypted message from Alice,  uses his private key to decrypt the message.

 

•Because only Bob knows his private key, only he can decrypt the message and read it!
