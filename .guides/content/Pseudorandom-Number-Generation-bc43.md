## Pick a Number

One of the required properties of a cryptographic function is that the output has to pass pseudorandomness tests. A cryptographic hash function can be used to construct a **pseudorandom function (PRF)** or a **pseudorandom number generator (PRNG)** so that the output from a hash can pass tests for pseudorandomness.
