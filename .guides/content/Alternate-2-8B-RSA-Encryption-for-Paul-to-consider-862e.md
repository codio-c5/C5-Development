### In 1977, three researchers at the MIT Laboratory of Computer Science came up with the RSA Encryption algorithm. Inspired by the work of Diffie and Helman[verify reference ps], RSA  (Named after inventors Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman) was the first viable and publically available public key encryption algorithm and became the foundation for secure global communication.

RSA encryption allows two strangers to securely and confidently communicate with each other. Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman discovered that they could calculate two numbers that are the inverse of each other by multiplying two prime numbers. This relationship satisfies the fundamental requirement of public key encryption: one number can be used as a public key and its inverse is used as the private key. The larger the prime numbers used, the more difficult it becomes to factor them, and the more secure the encryption. 

The Internet as we know it exists because RSA made e-commerce possible. RSA brilliantly combines mathematics spanning centuries and , in the case of the Euclidean algorithm, millenia.


RSA is included in the cipher suite for key agreement/exchange in TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Socket Layer).
