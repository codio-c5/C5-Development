Angy Shavit is an IT security auditor at a video gaming company in New York City.  Angy learned about cybersecurity at her first post-college job. She first became intrigued by the work thanks to a colleague's presentation, and she followed up with him to request a job shadow and mentorship. She loved it and started her career in the discipline.

We caught up with Angy by mobile phone at the airport to learn more about what she finds exciting about cybersecurity.
