## The Five Tenets of Information Security

The field of cybersecurity is about supporting secure digital communications. Secure communications requires that each of these tenets is met. 

In this module, you will learn about each tenet and how applied cryptography methods address them.

**Confidentiality** is the concept of ensuring that data is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized people. Confidentiality, achieved through encryption, was the original purpose of cryptography. In units 1 and 2, you will learn about different forms of cryptography, their strengths and weaknesses, and approaches for solving them.

**Integrity** is the concept of ensuring that data has not been altered in any way. Unit 3 explores **hash functions,** which are commonly used for this purpose.

**Authenticity** ensures that the data originated from the stated sender. Unit 4 describes **digital signatures** and  **digital certificates**  which are key to this process.

**Nonrepudiation** is the assurance that someone cannot deny something. Typically, nonrepudiation refers to the ability to ensure that a party to a contract or a communication cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or the sending of a message that they originated. Unit 4's  exploration of **digital signatures** and **digital certificates**  will also explore prevention of repudiation.
