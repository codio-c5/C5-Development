## The Rivest Digest

### In 1989, Ronald Rivest (of RSA fame) developed MD2 for 8-bit computers. It was replaced by MD4 and MD5. Both MD4 and MD5 have been broken and are no longer recommended for use.

**MD4** was designed for 32-bit computers, produced 128-bit digests, and was used in TLS certificates. It was compromised in collision attacks in 1995.

**MD5** replaced MD4 in 1991.  By 1996, the first weaknesses of MD5 were found. An effective collision attack was reported in 2004, and a preimage attack was published in 2009.
