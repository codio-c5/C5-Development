## Advantages and Disadvantages of Public Key Encryption
Since users share only a public key used for encryption, there is no issue about keeping key distribution a secret. Public keys can be broadly shared over non-secure channels and used by others in the system to encrypt messages for the key's creator. Only the key's creator has the private key that can be used to decrypt messages encrypted with their public key.

Public key encryption is less efficient than symmetric key encryption because symmetric key encryption produces significantly less ciphertext for a given plaintext.  This is typically an acceptable tradeoff today, given the high speed computer processing ability and the importance of confidentiality.
