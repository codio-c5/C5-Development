## Advantages and Disadvantages of Public Key Encryption
Since users share only a public key used for encryption, there is no issue about keeping key distribution a secret. Public keys can be broadly shared over non-secure channels and used by others in the system to encrypt messages for the key's creator. Only the key's creator has the private key that can be used to decrypt messages encrypted with their public key.

Public key encryption is significantly more computationally expensive, and requires more storage than symmetric key encryption.  This is typically an acceptable trade-off today, given the high speed computer processing ability and the importance of confidentiality.
