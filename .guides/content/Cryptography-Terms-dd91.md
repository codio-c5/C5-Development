 ***Cryptography*** is the practice and study of techniques for securing communication in the presence of adversaries.

Cryptography involves designing systems to store and transmit data in a secure way.  The goal of cryptography is to  preserve the integrity of the message and to make sure it is accessible only to those with proper authentication and authorization.

Modern cryptography has evolved to use increasingly complex mathematics to transform information in a way that makes it readily accessible by its intended audience but not by anyone else.

The process is straightforward: plaintext is converted into ciphertext and vice versa. 
||| definition 
**Plaintext** is a message or data that is not secret or hidden; the words on this page are an example of plaintext. **Encryption** transforms plaintext into **ciphertext,** or coded text, by using a **key,** which renders it unintelligible by anyone who does not possess the key used to perform the encryption. This prevents attackers from reading or changing the message.

**Decryption** reverses the process and allows anyone who possesses the key to obtain the original plaintext. In symmetric key cryptography, the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt messages.

In Unit 2, you'll learn about asymmetric, or public key, cryptography where different keys are used for encryption and decryption.
