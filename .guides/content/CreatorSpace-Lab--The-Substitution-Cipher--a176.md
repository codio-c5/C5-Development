Let's create an example key for a simple, monoalphabetic substitution cipher: `ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA`. In this example, it's just the alphabet reversed.

If we use it to encrypt the message “Never say never”.

we get the result:
`MVEVI HZB NVEVI`

You can see that it maps "A" to "Z", "B" to "Y" , etc.  

## Your Turn
You can play with the substitution cipher on the left. 
- One line 1 where you see "never say never", type "An apple a day keeps the doctor away".
- Click the `Encrypt` button.

{Encrypt}(substitution/subencrypt.sh)

- Click the `Decrypt` button.

{Decrypt}(substitution/subdecrypt.sh)
