Let's create an example key for a simple, monoalphabetic substitution cipher: `ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA`. In this example, it's just the alphabet reversed.

If we use it to encrypt the message “Never say never”.

we get the result:
`MVEVI HZB NVEVI`

You can see that it maps "A" to "Z", "B" to "Y" , etc.  

## Your Turn
You can experiment with the substitution cipher on the left. For instance, copy the previous key `ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA` and paste it into the text box in the upper left window. Alternatively, you can create your own key and enter it manually if you wish. (Duplicate characters will be removed and missing ones entered automatically.)

- On line 1 where you see "never say never", type "An apple a day keeps the doctor away".
- Click the `Encrypt` button.

{Encrypt}(substitution/subencrypt.sh)

- Click the `Decrypt` button.

{Decrypt}(substitution/subdecrypt.sh)
