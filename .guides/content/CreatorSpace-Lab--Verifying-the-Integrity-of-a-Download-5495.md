### In this lab you will verify that a file you download has not been changed during download by comparing hashes.


- First, you need to download a file that you can compare. **[Click here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openofficeorg.mirror/files/4.1.3/binaries/en-US/Apache_OpenOffice_4.1.3_Win_x86_langpack_en-US.exe/download)** to download Apache OpenOffice Language Pack. When the download has completed go to the next step.

## Calculate the hashes for the file 

The pane on the left is showing an  html5 file hash calculator.  There are a number of such calculators on the web.  You can use this one to compare hash values for the file you downloaded.

- A few  lines below the green box, select the **MD5** & **SHA256** options. (uncheck the other options).
- Drag and drop the file you downloaded into the green box.
- MD5 and SHA-256 hash values appear.
 - Enter the hash values below.

 - Now, go to the source of the download website. **[Click here.](open_preview https://www.openoffice.org/download/index.html panel=0)** 

 - Note that there are **links for MD5 and SHA256 hashes of the files** on the site.

### Now download the hashes for comparison. 
 - **[Click here](https://archive.apache.org/dist/openoffice/4.1.3/binaries/en-US/Apache_OpenOffice_4.1.3_Win_x86_langpack_en-US.exe.md5)** to download the **MD5** hash for the Language Pack and save it on your computer.
- Open it with Notepad.
### Enter the MD5 hash value below.

 - **[Click here](https://archive.apache.org/dist/openoffice/4.1.3/binaries/en-US/Apache_OpenOffice_4.1.3_Win_x86_langpack_en-US.exe.sha256)** to download the **SHA256** for the Language pack and save it on your computer
- Open it with Notepad.
### Enter the SHA-256 hash value below.
