## Cryptography and Language
 Language is a critical key in cryptography.  If you decode the ciphertext `GRRUTY TUAY XKTIUTZXKX JKSGOT` by using a shift key of `6`, you get *Allons nous rencontrer demain.*  But if you don't know that the message is in French, you'll miss the request: "Let's meet tomorrow." You might not even recognize that you have decoded the ciphertext.

Cryptography might have changed the outcome of one of the most monumental defeats in military history. During World War I, the Russian 2nd Army had marched beyond the reach of their encrypted telegraph lines. They sent communications over open lines (that is, without encryption), thinking that the Germans would not understand Russian. But the Germans easily translated the Russian communications and were able to outflank the 2nd Army at the  [Battle of Tannenberg](http://thebattleoftannenburgww1.weebly.com/the-battle-and-battle-tactics.html). There were over 300,000 Russian casualties, the 2nd Army was forced to surrender, and 90,000 soldiers were taken prisoner. This defeat was likely one factor contributing to the overthrow of the Czar by the communists, and so it helped change the direction of 20th-century history.

### Code Talkers: If your enemy knows your language, what language wonâ€™t they know? ###

In Word Wars I and II, the US military used Native American languages like Navajo to communicate secretly. Initially, certain agreed-upon Navajo words were given military meaning.  Later, a cipher key was developed in which a Navajo word was used to represent a specific letter in the English alphabet. The code was never broken by the enemy, and it proved to be a significant advantage in various battles (such as Iwo Jima).
