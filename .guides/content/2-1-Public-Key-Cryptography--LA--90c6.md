### What do you know about public key cryptography? As you know cryptography is the study of protecting information through the use of codes and ciphers. Cryptography forms a fundamental part of message security. In 1976, Whitfield Diffe and Martin Hellman created public key cryptography. Public key cryptography represents a major innovation because it fundamentally alters the process of encryption and decryption.
