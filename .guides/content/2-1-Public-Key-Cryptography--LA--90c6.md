## What do you know about public key cryptography? As you know cryptography is the study of protecting information through the use of codes and ciphers. Cryptography forms a fundamental part of message security. In 1976, Whitfield Diffe and Martin Hellman created public key cryptography. Public key cryptography represents a major innovation because it fundamentally alters the process of encryption and decryption. 

Do you have some familiarity with public key cryptography? Try out these  questions before you dig in. You might not get them right yet, but by the end of this lesson, you'll know them all.
