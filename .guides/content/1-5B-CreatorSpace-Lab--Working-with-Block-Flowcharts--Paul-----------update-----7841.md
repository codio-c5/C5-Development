The flowchart on the left is more interesting. It runs like a real program. Now it's your turn to experiment. Hover over the first arrow at the top and the screen and you'll see the label "Run"; hover over the 2nd arrow and the "Step" message pops up.

Click the Step button and the first variable box in the diagram is highlighted. The debugging panel also opens at the bottom of the screen showing the variables used by the shift algorithm. Continue to click the Step button to move through the algorithm until it completes and the "Program finished" dialog pops up. Once you get the hang of it you can click the "Run" button to complete the task.
