The flowchart on the left is a bit more interesting. This one runs like a real program. 

Now it's your time to experiment. Hover over the 1st arrow at the top and the screen and you'll see that its label "Run"; hover over the 2nd arrow and the "Step" message pops up.

Click the Step button and the first variable box in the diagram is highlighted. The debugging panel also opens at the bottom of the screen showing the variables used by the shift algorithm. Continuing to click the Step button moves you through the algorithm until it completes and the "Program finished" dialog pops up. Once you get the hang of it you can click the "Run" button to complete the task.
