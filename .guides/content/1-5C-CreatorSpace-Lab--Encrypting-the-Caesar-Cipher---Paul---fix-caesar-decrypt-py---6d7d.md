Let's play with a real example.

The first verse of *Take Me Out To the Ball Game* is shown. This is plaintext you want to encrypt.

On the next line (line 5) add the next line of the song: **It's root, root, root for the home team.** 

Then, press the button below to encrypt the file using the Caesar Cipher. You will see the encrypted text in the panel below. 

{Encrypt}(.guides/caesare.sh)

Once you are done, try decrypting on the next page.
