## Comparing and Contrasting Block Ciphers

There are several modern block ciphers that have different strengths and weaknesses.  Some of the most well known include: 

1. RC4
1. DES
1. Triple DES (3DES)
1. IDEA
1. Camellia
1. AES

Research each cipher on the Internet to answer the following questions:
- What is the key size?
- What are its strengths?
- Does it have any security vulnerabilities?
- Does it have any downsides that make it less usable?

**Instructor's Note:** As a Meetup, divide your class into groups and have each group take on one of the ciphers. Have the groups report back to the class at large with their findings.
