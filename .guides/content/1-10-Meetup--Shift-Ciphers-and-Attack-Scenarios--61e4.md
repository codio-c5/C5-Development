## Cryptanalysts: How would you crack it?

*Divide into groups. Each group is assigned one of the scenarios below. As a group discuss what approach you would take to solve your scenario.*


**1. Ciphertext only attacks:** What do you do to break the cipher if all you have is the ciphertext: `GJFZYNKZQ IFD?`

**2. Known plaintext attacks:** What do you do to break the cipher if you know that HELLO encrypts to `MJQQT`? 

**3. Chosen plaintext attacks:** What do you do to break the cipher if you can choose  a plaintext and get its ciphertext but no key? 

**4. Chosen ciphertext attacks:** What do you do to break the cipher if you can choose  a ciphertext and get its plaintext but no key?
