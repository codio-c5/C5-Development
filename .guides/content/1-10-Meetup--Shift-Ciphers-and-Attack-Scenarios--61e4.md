## Calling All Cryptanalysts: How would you crack it?

*What approach you would take to solve each scenario?*


**1. Ciphertext only attacks:** What do you do to break the cipher if all you have is the ciphertext: `GJFZYNKZQ IFD?`

**2. Known plaintext attacks:** What do you do to break the cipher if you know that HELLO encrypts to `MJQQT`? 

**3. Chosen plaintext attacks:** What do you do to break the cipher if you can choose  a plaintext and get its ciphertext but no key? 

**4. Chosen ciphertext attacks:** What do you do to break the cipher if you can choose  a ciphertext and get its plaintext but no key?

**Instructor's Note:**  This works great as a Meetup.  Divide your class into groups and have each group take on one of the four scenarios. Have the groups report back to the class at large with their findings.
