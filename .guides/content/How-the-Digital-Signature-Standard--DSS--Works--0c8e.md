## Advantages and Disadvantages of Digital Signatures
Digital signatures use an encryption of the hash value to validate the source integrity of a message.  Hash values are small, so the process is fast.

Digital signatures verify that the message really came from the sender and wasn't tampered with between the sender and the recipient, but it doesn't **authenticate** the sender or validate who the sender really is.
