### Want to dig in deeper?
Hackathons are optional projects that explore a topic more deeply.  Some Hackathons have you working with others to explore aspects of what you have learned. Whether on your own, with a partner, or a small group, these projects will get you going.

In **Hackathon 1,** you can explore how a shift cipher is rendered in a flowchart format.

In **Hackathon 2,** you can get creative about ways to secretly share a key with a partner.
