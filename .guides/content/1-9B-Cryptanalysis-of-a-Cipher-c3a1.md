So, how do you crack a code?

Cryptanalysts first need to know what information they have to create a decoding strategy.  The elements of a code are the original plaintext, the resulting ciphertext, and the encryption/decryption key. To crack a code, your strategy depends on what you have. 

Following Kerckhoffsâ€™s Principle, let's assume that the details of the algorithm used for encryption is known. If you know the key, then you can simply convert plaintext or ciphertext with ease.

If you don't know the key, then you have to solve for it.  If you have only ciphertext, then you use 

## Add info here
If the algorithm is a simple one, like Caesar cipher, then you have a clear path to decryption. You can simply start shifting the first word of ciphertext until 


Describe the process if the hacker has
 - Ciphertext?
 - Pairs of plaintexts and ciphertexts?
 - The ability to choose any plaintext (and obtain the corresponding ciphertext) without knowledge of the key?
 - The ability to choose certain ciphertexts and get the corresponding plaintext without knowledge of the key?
