## Frequency Analysis and Literature 
### Frequency analysis might fail you if the plaintext is unusual. Consider the case of a novel that does not use the letter "e".

The French novel <u>La Disparition</u> by Geroges Perec was written without using the letter 'e'.  It was later translated into English by Gilbert Adair under the title <u>A Void,</u> which also does not use the letter 'e'.   The image on the left shows the English and French book covers, and a sample of the English language text.
