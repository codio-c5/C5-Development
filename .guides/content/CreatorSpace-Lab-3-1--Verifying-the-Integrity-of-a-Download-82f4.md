## Prying Eyes Stay Away!
In this lab you'll compare hashes to verify that a file you download has not been changed during download.


- First, you need to download a file with hashes that you can compare. **[Click here](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/development/chapter03/packages.html)** to to go a web site that provides Open Source Linux files.

- Next, click on any file to download the package. For instance, click on the first file that in this case is ```Acl (2.2.52)```.

- Take note of the MD5 sum displayed under the package.

- Save the file using the ```Save file``` dialog.

When the download has completed, go to the next step.
