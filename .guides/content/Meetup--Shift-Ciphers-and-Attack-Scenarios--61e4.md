## Calling All Cryptanalysts: How would you crack it?

*What approach you would take to solve each scenario?*


**1. Ciphertext-only attacks:** What do you do to break the cipher if all you have is the following ciphertext: `GJFZYNKZQ IFD`?

**2. Known plaintext attacks:** What do you do to break the cipher if you know that "hello" encrypts to `MJQQT`? 

**3. Chosen plaintext attacks:** What do you do to break the cipher if you can choose  a plaintext and get its ciphertext but you don't know the key? 

**4. Chosen ciphertext attacks:** What do you do to break the cipher if you can choose  a ciphertext and get its plaintext but you don't know the key?

**Instructor's Note:**  Divide your class into groups and have each group take on one of the four scenarios. Have the groups report back to the class at large with their findings.

**Instructor's Note:** 
**Answers** 
**Ciphertext only attacks –**  Brute force the 26 possible keys and see which gives a comprehensible message.
**Known plaintext attacks –** Figure out how much H is shifted to get to M.
**Chosen plaintext attacks –** Choose A or any other letter for the plaintext.
**Chosen ciphertext attacks –** Choose A or any other letter for the ciphertext.
The correct plaintext for the ciphertext `GJFZYNKZQ IFD` is BEAUTIFUL DAY.
