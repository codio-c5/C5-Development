**Young Alan Turing:** What's that you're reading?
**Christopher Morcom:** It's about cryptography.
**Young Alan Turing:** Like secret messages?
**Christopher Morcom:** Not secret. That's the brilliant part. Messages that anyone can see but no one knows what they mean, unless you have the key.
**Young Alan Turing:** How's that different from talking?
**Christopher Morcom:** Talking?
**Young Alan Turing:** When people talk to each other, they never say what they mean, they say something else. And you're expected to just know what they mean. Only I never do. So... How's that different?
**Christopher Morcom:** Alan, I have a funny feeling you're going to be very good at this.
