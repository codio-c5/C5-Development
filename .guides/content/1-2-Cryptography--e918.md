**Young Alan Turing:** What's that you're reading?
**Christopher Morcom:** It's about cryptography.
**Young Alan Turing:** Like secret messages?
**Christopher Morcom:** Not secret. That's the brilliant part. Messages that anyone can see but no one knows what they mean, unless you have the key.
**Young Alan Turing:** How's that different from talking?
**Christopher Morcom:** Talking?
**Young Alan Turing:** When people talk to each other, they never say what they mean, they say something else. And you're expected to just know what they mean. Only I never do. So... How's that different?
**Christopher Morcom:** Alan, I have a funny feeling you're going to be very good at this.

During World War II, Alan Turing and his team in British intelligence were able to crack the German Enigma code.  Historians estimate that this shortened the war by two to three years and saved tens of millions of lives.

 ***Cryptography*** is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversaries.

Cryptography involves designing systems to store and transmit data in a secure way.  The goal of cryptography is to  preserve the integrity of the message and make sure is only accessible to those with proper authentication and authorization.

Modern cryptography has evolved to use increasingly complex mathematics to transform information in a way that is readily accessible by its intended audience, but not by anyone else.

Then process is straightforward. It converts plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa. **Plaintext** is a message or data that is not secret or hidden; the words on this page are an example of plaintext. Encryption transforms plaintext into **ciphertext,** or coded text, using a key, which renders it unintelligible by anyone who does not possess the key used to perform the encryption. This prevents attackers from reading or changing the message. Decryption reverses the process and allows anyone who possesses the key to obtain the original plaintext. In symmetric key cryptography, the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt messages. In later chapters, you'll learn about asymmetric cryptography where different keys are used for encryption and decryption.

### Instructor's Note
Here's a good cryptography overview video you might share with the class.
