### A Deeper Dive
This unit's Hackathons explore how public key algorithms work by getting into the math behind the scenes. 

In **Hackathon 1,** you'll learn about Fermat and Euler,  and how their theories from long ago have shaped cutting edge ideas for public key encryption.

In **Hackathon 2,** you'll get under the hood with the popular RSA algorithm and learn how it works.
