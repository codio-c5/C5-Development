## Comparing and Contrasting Block Ciphers

Divide into teams. Each team is assigned one of the following symmetric ciphers know as block ciphers that are in use today.  For example, the secure network protocol TLS/SSL (Transport layer Security/Secure Socket Layer) lists the following block ciphers in its suite of ciphers:

1. RC4
1. DES
1. Triple DES (3DES)
1. IDEA
1. Camellia

Research your assigned cipher on the internet to answer the following questions.  Share your results with the class.
- How does your assigned cipher work?
- What is (was) it used for?
- What are its strengths?
- Does it have any security vulnerabilities?
- Does it have any down sides that make it less usable?
