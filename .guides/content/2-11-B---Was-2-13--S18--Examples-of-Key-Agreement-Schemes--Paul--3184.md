Stanford University researchers Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman came up with the concept of key agreement in 1976, which they called the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DH). Independently, Ralph Merkle arrived at a similar approach around the same time.

The process involved sharing public keys and using private keys to calculate a shared session key. large prime numbers are used as the keys.

ECC is another example in which points on the curve are used as the keys.  It has been included in the cipher suite for key agreement/exchange in TLS/SSL and Bluetooth (LE) protocols, due to its relatively small key size.
