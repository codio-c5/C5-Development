IBM created the Data Encryption Standard (DES) encryption algorithm in 1970's. Following Kerckhoffsâ€™s Principle, they submitted it to the National Bureau of Standards for rigorous inspection. That, plus a version modified and endorsed by the NSA, led to it's worldwide use for protecting non-classified, sensitive data.
