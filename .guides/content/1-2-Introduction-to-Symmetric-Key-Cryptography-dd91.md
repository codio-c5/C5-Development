Cryptography involves designing systems to store and transmit data in a secure way.  The goal of cryptography is to  preserve the integrity of the message and make sure is only accessible to those with proper authentication and authorization.

Modern cryptography has evolved to use increasingly complex mathematics to transform information in a way that is readily accessible by its intended audience, but not by anyone else.

The process is straightforward. It converts plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa. **Plaintext** is a message or data that is not secret or hidden; the words on this page are an example of plaintext. Encryption transforms plaintext into **ciphertext,** or coded text, using a key, which renders it unintelligible by anyone who does not possess the key used to perform the encryption. This prevents attackers from reading or changing the message. Decryption reverses the process and allows anyone who possesses the key to obtain the original plaintext. In symmetric key cryptography, the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt messages. In later chapters, you'll learn about asymmetric cryptography where different keys are used for encryption and decryption.
