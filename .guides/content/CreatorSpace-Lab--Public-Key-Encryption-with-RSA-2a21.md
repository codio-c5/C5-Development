## Creating Secret Messages with RSA
In this three-part lab, you break into pairs or small groups. You will then use RSA to complete the following steps:

1. Each individual or group will generate a key pair.
1. Designate one group as Alice and one as Bob, then have Alice share her public key with Bob.
1. Bob will create a message and encrypt it with Alice's public key.
1. Bob will send the ciphertext to Alice.
1. Alice will now decrypt the message using her private key.

Compare results.

Afterwards, you can reverse the process and have the opposite groups be Alice and Bob and send another message.

Each group should get their original plaintext back.
