In this three-part lab, you break into pairs or small groups. You will then use RSA to complete the following steps:

1. Each individual or group will generate a key pair.
1. You then share your public key with your partner and vice versa.
1. Using your partners public key, encrypt a message.
    Have your partner do the same using their message and your public key.
1. Send your ciphertext to your partner.
    Have your partner send you their ciphertext.
1. Use your private key to decrypt their message
    They decrypt your message using their private key.
