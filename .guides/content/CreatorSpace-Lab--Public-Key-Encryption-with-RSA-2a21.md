## Creating Secret Messages with RSA
In this three-part lab, you break into pairs or small groups. One will be Alice and the other Bob. You will then use RSA to complete the following steps:

1. Each individual or group - Alice and Bob - will generate a key pair.
1. Designate one group as Alice and one as Bob, then have Alice share her public key with Bob.
1. Bob will create a message and encrypt it with Alice's public key.
1. Bob will send the ciphertext to Alice.
1. Alice will now decrypt the message using her private key.
1. Compare results.
