Not unlike paper equivalents, digital signatures are unique to each document. On paper, you might use different types of pens and paper, or your angle could change. Each of your signatures follows a specific pattern, yet is intrinsically unique. 

Every digital signature is a completely unique code. The differences in digital signatures is more obvious than paper signatures, and easier to authenticate as well. Each individual digital signature is creating using a private key algorithm, yet, like a fingerprint, each is unique.

To keep the digital signature  process efficient, the hash value of a message is signed rather than the message itself. You'll remember from the last lesson that a hash value has a fixed length that is typically much smaller than the message itself.
