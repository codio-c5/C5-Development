### In the last unit, you learned that the weakness of symmetric key encryption is the secure distribution of the shared key. This problem can be solved in two ways-- through public key encryption or by key agreement algorithms.

Public Key (asymmetric) Encryption uses an asymmetric (public key) encryption and send over an unsecured channel.

## Key Agreement Algorithms

Uses public and private keys to agree on a third key, **the session key,** without exchanging any private information.
