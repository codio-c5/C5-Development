### The greatest flaw in symmetric key encryption is the secure distribution of the shared key. Getting the key to just the person you want --and no one else-- is tricky over unsecured channels.

### This problem can be solved in two ways-- through public key encryption (also known as asymmetric encryption) or by key agreement algorithms.

## Public Key (asymmetric) Encryption 
uses an asymmetric (public key) encryption and send over an unsecured channel.

## Key Agreement Algorithms

Uses public and private keys to agree on a third key, **the session key,** without exchanging any private information.
