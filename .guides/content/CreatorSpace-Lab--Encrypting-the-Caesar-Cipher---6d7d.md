Let's play around with a real example.

The first verse of the song *Take Me Out To the Ball Game* is shown. This is the plaintext you will encrypt in this lab.

On line 5, add the next line of the song: **Let me root, root, root for the home team.** 

Next, press the ENCRYPT button below to encrypt the file using the Caesar cipher. You will see the encrypted text in the panel below. 

{Encrypt}(.guides/caesare.sh)

Once you are done, try decrypting the ciphertext on the next page.
