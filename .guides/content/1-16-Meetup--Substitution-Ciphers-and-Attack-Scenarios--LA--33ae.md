## Cryptanalysts: How would you crack it?

*Divide into four groups. Each group is assigned one of the scenarios below. As a group discuss what approach you would take to decrypt a ciphertext if...*


**1. Ciphertext only attacks:** What do you do to break the cipher if all you have is the ciphertext?

**2. Known plaintext attacks:** What do you do to break the cipher if you know that HELLO encrypts to MYZZK? How do you find the key?

**3. Chosen plaintext attacks:** What do you do to break the cipher if you can choose a plaintext and get its ciphertext but no key? 

**4. Chosen ciphertext attacks:** What do you do to break the cipher if you can choose a ciphertext and get its plaintext but no key? 

*Assign a speaker to represent your group, and share the findings with the rest of the class.*
