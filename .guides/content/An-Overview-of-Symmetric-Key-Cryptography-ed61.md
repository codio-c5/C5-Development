## Advantages and Disadvantages of Symmetric Key Encryption
The advantage of using symmetric key encryption is that it is more efficient than public key encryption (also known as asymmetric key encryption), which you'll learn about in Unit 2. Symmetric key encryption produces significantly less ciphertext for a given plaintext. However, safely getting the key to the right people  and keeping the key away from attackers is more difficult than with public key encryption.
