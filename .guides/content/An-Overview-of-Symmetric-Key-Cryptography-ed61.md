## Advantages and Disadvantages of Symmetric Key Encryption
The advantage of symmetric key encryption is that it is more efficient than asymmetric key, or public key, encryption, which you'll learn about in Unit 2. Symmetric key encryption produces significantly less ciphertext for a given plaintext. However, the challenge with symmetric key is that getting the key to the right people and keeping it away from attackers is more difficult than with asymmetric key (public key) encryption.
