## The SHA-shank Redemption

### In 2001, NIST published SHA-2 as a federal standard for information processing.  

Also developed by the NSA, SHA-2 differs from its predecessors by including six hash functions with digests that are 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits. 

SHA-2 is widely used in communication protocols, including TLS and SSL, PGP, SSH, S/MIME, and IPsec.  No attacks have yet defeated SHA-2.

### In 2012, NIST held a five-year competition to determine SHA-3. 

**Keccak,** the sponge function, is an algorithm designed by Guido Bertoni, Joan Daemen, Michael Peeters, and Gilles Van Assche. It was selected and published by NIST as SHA-3 in 2015.  It is a new standard, in addition to SHA-2.

SHA-3 is very different from its predecessors, which means it won't be vulnerable in ways that SHA-2 might be. It is also compact, which makes it versatile for use in small devices such as remote sensors.
