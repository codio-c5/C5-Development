## The SHA-shank Redemption

### In 2001, NIST published SHA-2 as a federal standard for information processing.  

Also developed by the NSA, SHA-2 differs from its predecessors as it includes six hash functions with digests that are 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits. 

SHA-2 is widely used in protocols including TLS and SSL, PGP, SSH, S/MIME, and IPsec.  No attacks have yet defeated SHA-2.

### In 2012, NIST held a 5-year competition to determine SHA-3. 

**Keccak,** the algorithm designed by Guido Bertoni, Joan Daemen, Michael Peeters, and Gilles Van Assche was selected and published by NIST as SHA-3 in 2015.  It is  a new standard in addition to SHA-2.

SHA-3 is very different from its predecessors, which means it won't be vulnerable in ways that SHA-2 might be. It is compact, which makes it versatile for use in small devices such as remote sensors.
