Here's an example of the Caesar cipher in action. Clicking on the Encryption button applies the cipher to the plaintext to create ciphertext.

{Encrypt}(.guides/caesare.sh)

As shown above, the cipher algorithm shifts each letter by the number specified by the key. The algorithm is encoded in the Python script to the left.

{Decrypt}(.guides/caesard.sh)

Now, click the Decrypt key and the same algorithm is applied in reverse order specified by the key.

`caesar-encrypt.py` handles the encryption
`caesar-decrypt.py` handles the decryption

You can open these up by clicking on them in the file tree.
