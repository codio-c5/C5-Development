## Calling All Cryptanalysts: How would you crack it?
What approach you would take to solve each scenario?


**1. Ciphertext only attacks:** What do you do to break the cipher if all you have is the ciphertext?

**2. Known plaintext attacks:** What do you do to break the cipher if you know that HELLO encrypts to `MYZZK`? How do you find the key?

**3. Chosen plaintext attacks:** What do you do to break the cipher if you can choose a plaintext and get its ciphertext but no key? 

**4. Chosen ciphertext attacks:** What do you do to break the cipher if you can choose a ciphertext and get its plaintext but no key?

**Instructor's Note:** As with the Meetup for shift ciphers, this works great as a Meetup.  Divide your class into groups and have each group take on one of the four scenarios. Have the groups report back to the class at large with their findings.
