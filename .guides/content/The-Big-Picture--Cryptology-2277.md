||| definition 
 **Cryptology** is a scientific field devoted to studying cryptography and cryptanalysis.
|||


- **Cryptography**, a field within the science of cryptology, focuses on designing systems to provide security and keep information secret. **Cryptologists** create the algorithms and techniques that keep information safe. They create **ciphers,** or secret or disguised ways of writing (codes), to secure information.

- **Cryptanalysis** focuses on breaking the systems designed to provide security. It is also part of the field of cryptology. **Cryptanalysts** are people who study cryptographic ciphers with the aim of breaking them. Today, you may have heard them referred to as **hackers.** Alan Turing is an example of a cryptanalyst.
