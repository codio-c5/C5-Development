- **Cryptography** focuses on designing systems to provide security. Cryptography is a field with the science of cryptology. It focuses on the systems that keep information secret. **Cryptologists** create the algorithms and techniques that keep information safe.

- **Cryptanalysis** focuses on breaking these systems. Cryptanalysis is also part of the field of cryptology. It studies cryptographic ciphers with the aim of breaking them. **Cryptanalysts** are people who seek to break a cipher. Today, you may have heard them called **hackers.** Alan Turing is an example of a cryptanalyst.
