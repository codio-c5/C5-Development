### In 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman created public key cryptography. It fundamentally alters the process by establishing separate, one-way paths for encryption and decryption. 

Diffie and Hellman solved the issue of key distribution by realizing that you could encrypt a message securely using a broadly shared public key if the sender didn't need to decrypt it again.  Only the recipient would be able to decrypt the ciphertext using a private key.

|||definition 
**Public key cryptography** is a type of **asymmetric encryption** because a different key is used for encryption and decryption. 

A **key pair** is generated by each user, and consists of a **public key** and a **private key**.  The **public key** is broadly shared and used by others to encrypt messages for the key's owner.  The **private key**  is used by its owner to decrypt messages sent to them.

 The sender can encrypt plaintext so that the recipient can decrypt it, but no one else, not even the sender, can decrypt it without knowing the recipient's private key. 

## How it works:
 - Each user generates a pair of keys that consist of a public and a private key.  
 - The users share their public keys, but keeps the private key to themselves.
 - The sender encrypts her message with the receiver's public key to create a ciphertext she can send to the receiver.
 - The receiver is able to decrypt the ciphertext using his private key. 
 - The receiver can then send a response by encrypting the plaintext using the initial sender's public key.
 - The initial sender can decrypt the message using her private key.
