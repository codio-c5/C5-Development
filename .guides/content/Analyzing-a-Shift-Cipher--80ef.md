The Caesar cipher worked well for its time and was often used to communicate battlefield instructions. Back then, computing power was limited to the abacus, which was not useful for breaking codes. The concept of encryption was virtually unknown, and anyone who intercepted such messages would have thought they were written in another language. There are no recorded incidents of the Caesar cipher having been broken in ancient times. Such simple encryption methods remained adequate for centuries.

Today, the abacus has given way to powerful, inexpensive computers that can break such a cipher in a microsecond. However, computers aren't necessary for the purpose of breaking simple shift ciphers. It can be done with a pencil and paper.


Recall that the Caesar cipher simply shifts each character in a message by a fixed amount. Because there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, there are only 26-1, or 25, possible shifts or keys.  This is referred to as the **key size** of the shift cipher. Each alphabet's shift cipher key size is determined by the number of letters in the alphabet.

Shifting by 0 in the English alphabet would mean that A remains A and the plaintext wouldn't change at all. Shifting by 26 would bring you all the way around to A again, once again resulting in no change to the plaintext. But you can take the first few characters in a ciphertext and shift them by 1, then by 2, and so on until you see a legible word or part of a word.

**Key size** refers to the number of possible solutions for a cipher. The larger the key size, the harder a cipher is to break. Imagine if you had to use only pen and paper to break a cipher with a key size of 1,000,000 or even only 1,000!

As computing power has increased from use of the abacus to first generation computers and now to modern, powerful computers, cryptography has become increasingly complex. Ever more powerful computers are needed to crack increasingly sophisticated cryptographic ciphers.
