They say a chain is as strong as its weakest link.  The same is true about information security.  In this module you learned about designing systems to provide security, and the techniques hackers use to break them. The focus has been on properly implemented techniques and the theories behind them.  In the real world, the downfall is often something other than the algorithm. It might be old hardware, out of date software, or people and policies not following the rules. This is where public key infrastructure comes  in.

PKI allows people and organizations to reliably and securely communicate with each other whether they are in the same location or across the world.

PKI creates policies and proceedures to manage digital certificates. Those certificates verify whether the communicating parties are who they claim to be - or not. Once verified, the parties use the other cryptographic techniques and tools described in previous chapters to encrypt their communications.

PKI relies on the concept of trust by extension. Two parties who need to communicate over an untrusted channel, like the email, can use a trusted third party to prevent man-in-the-middle. This is analogous to using a Notary Public when mailing paper contracts.

||| definition
**Public key infrastructure (PKI)** is a framework that specifies procedures and policies necessary to ensure the proper level of security.  PKI addresses hardware and software specifications, employee procedures and training,and every factor necessary to create, manage, store, distribute, and revoke **digital certificates.**
