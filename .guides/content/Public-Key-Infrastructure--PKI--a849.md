They say a chain is as strong as its weakest link.  The same is true about information security.  Earlier you learned about algorithms that provide security and the techniques hackers use to break them. The focus has been on properly implemented techniques and the theories behind them.  

In the real world, the downfall is often something other than the algorithm. It might be old hardware, out of date software, people not following the rules, or inadequate security policies. This is where public key infrastructure comes in.
|||definition
**Public key infrastructure (PKI)** is a framework that allows people and organizations to reliably and securely communicate with each other whether they are in the same location or across the world.

PKI creates policies and procedures to manage **digital certificates.** Digital  certificates verify whether the communicating parties are who they claim to be. Once verified, the parties use other cryptographic techniques to encrypt their communications. PKI addresses hardware and software specifications, employee procedures and training, and every factor necessary to create, manage, store, distribute, and revoke digital certificates.

Like using a notary public to validate paper contracts, PKI relies on the concept of **trust by extension,** also referred to as the **chain of trust.** When two parties need to communicate over an unsecured channel like e-mail, they can use a trusted third party to prevent a man-in-the-middle attack.
