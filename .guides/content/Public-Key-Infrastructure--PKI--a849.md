PKI allows people and organizations to reliably and securely communicate with each other whether they are in the same location or across the world.

PKI creates policies and proceedures to manage digital certificates. Those certificates verify whether the communicating parties are who they claim to be - or not. Once verified, the parties use the other cryptographic techniques and tools described in previous chapters to encrypt their communications.

PKI relies on the concept of trust by extension. Two parties who need to communicate over an untrusted channel, like the email, can use a trusted third party to prevent man-in-the-middle. This is analogous to using a Notary Public when mailing paper contracts.
