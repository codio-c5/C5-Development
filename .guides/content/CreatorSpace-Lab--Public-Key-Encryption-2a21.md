### In this lab you will break into pairs or small groups to send and receive encrypted messages.

To start, [click here](cmd ./cleanup.sh) to clean up any previous work.

## Generate Your Keys

On the left is a Linux terminal window. You will use it to enter a command to create a private/public key pair.

 - To generate a private/public key pair, [Click here](cmd ./keygen.sh private.txt public.txt) to run the command below

```keygen.sh private.txt public.txt```

 - Click on the folder ```rsa/lab-part1``` in the file tree on the left.
  - Open up the private key file that has been created.

 - Copy and paste the private key into the box below.

## Send The Public Key

 - Download the public key file and send it to your partner via email. To download, right click on the public key file name in the tree on the left and select "Download".

In order to avoid confusion later in the unit, we recommend you rename your file by adding your name to the file name. e.g. ```Steve_public.txt```
