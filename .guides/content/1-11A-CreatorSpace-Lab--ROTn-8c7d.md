The ROTate by 13 places cipher (ROT13) is variation of the Caesar cipher. It shifts each character 13 places, or mid-way through the Latin (i.e., English) alphabet. This is not an arbitrary choice because the ROT13 cipher will encrypt a plaintext message the first time it's applied and decrypt the ciphertext the 2nd time it's applied. It's like moving the hour hand of a clock ahead 6 hours and then forward again by 6 hours and ending up where you started.

As we've learned shift ciphers provide little or no encryption. However, the ROT13 cipher is still a useful tool. It's used to hide information like plot spoilers from on-line from a casual glance. It's also good for teaching introductory cryptography!

The interactive ROT13 on the left hand side is an application that lets you experiment with the substitution algorithm.

Enter some text in the main text area and then press **Analyze** or **Show ROTn**.

Enter a plaintext message and click the ROT13 button and you'll the ciphertext. Click the key again and you get the plaintext back.
