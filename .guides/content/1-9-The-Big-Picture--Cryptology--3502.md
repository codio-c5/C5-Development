||| definition 
 **Cryptology** is a scientific field devoted to studying cryptography and cryptanalysis.
|||


- **Cryptography** focuses on designing systems to provide security. Cryptology is a field of cryptography. It focuses on the systems that keep information secret. **Cryptologists** create the algorithms and techniques that keep information safe.

- **Cryptanalysis** focuses on breaking these systems.
Cryptanalysis is also part of Cryptography. It studies crytographic ciphers with the aim of breaking or finding weaknesses that can have the potential of ultimately breaking a cipher. **Cryptanalysts** are people who seek to break a cipher. Today, you may have heard them called **hackers.** Alan Turing is an example of a cryptanalyst.
