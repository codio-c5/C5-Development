Substitution ciphers are similar to shift ciphers in that they create ciphertext by shifting, or mapping, characters to other characters. In its simplest form the key is the alphabet shifted by some number, in which case it operates like a Caesar cipher. This type of cipher is referred to as **monographic**.

Ciphertext is decrypted by simply reversing the process.

You can achive better results by scrambling the alphabet to create the key. This increases the effective key size, which makes for better encryption.

Individual characters can also be replaced by multiple groupings. For instance, the letter "A", might be replaced with "TL". This is called a **pologygraphic** substitution cipher. This increases the **key size**, but ultimately does not provide adequate encryption, because computers can quickly analyze and decrypt the ciphertext. Ultimately are not a signficant improvement on shift ciphers.
