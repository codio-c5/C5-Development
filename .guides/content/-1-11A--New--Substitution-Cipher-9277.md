Define substitution Cipher
Describe how it is different from a shift cipher.


|||
In a **substitution cipher**, each letter/character in the plaintext alphabet is substituted by a different letter/character in the ciphertext alphabet.
|||
The substitution cipher replaces each letter for a different letter of the alphabet  for the plaintext and ciphertext. The key is some reordering of the letters in the alphabet.

For example, the key:
           ```ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA```
would mean A is mapped to Z, B is mapped to Y, etc.
