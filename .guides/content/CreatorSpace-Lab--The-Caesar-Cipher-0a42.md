## Want to try it out?
In CreatorSpace Labs you get to roll up your sleeves and see how things work.  Some labs involve partners or group work, and for some, you're on your own.

Each lab steps you through a task, then offers you a chance to get creative on your own.  Each lab concludes with Lab Check In questions where you can verify what you've learned.

In this lab, you will create messages, encrypt them, and practice decrypting messages with the Caesar cipher, which is a type of shift cipher.
