## Generate Your Keys

To get started, you will generate a key pair; your partner will do the same. A key pair consists of a private key and a public key.

Click the Generate keys button.

{Generate keys}(sh rsa/keygen.sh) 

The file tree on the left shows the keys, along with other files, that you just generated. One is ```private.key``` and the ```public.key```.

 - Click on the private key in the file tree, on the left, and a tab opens in this space showing its contents. (You can move between the tabs by clicking on them.)
 - Copy and paste the private key into the box below.

## Download The Public Key

 - Have the team designated as Alice download their public key file. To download, right click on the public key file name in the tree on the left and select "Download". 

## Rename and Email Public Key

- You and your partner(s) will be exchanging public keys - in order to avoid confusion later in the unit, we recommend you rename your file (that you just downloaded) by adding your name to the file name. e.g. ```Alice_public.key```

- Now email the renamed public key file to your partner (Bob)
