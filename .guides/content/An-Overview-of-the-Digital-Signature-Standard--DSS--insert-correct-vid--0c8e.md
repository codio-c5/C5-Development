## Advantages and Disadvantages of Digital Signatures
Digital signatures use an encryption of the hash value to validate the source integrity of a message.  As hash values are small, the process is as fast as the message encryption itself.

Digital signatures verify that the sender is really the sender and that the message wasn't tampered with between the sender and the recipient, but it doesn't validate who the sender really is.
