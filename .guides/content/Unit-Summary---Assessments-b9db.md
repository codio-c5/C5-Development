A **digital signature** uses public key encryption to validate the hash value of a message. 
Digital signatures help solve the information security issues of **integrity** and **non-repudiation,**  but they don't authenticate the sending and receiving entities.

**Public key infrastructure (PKI)** does offer authentication.  PKI is a framework that establishes **a chain of trust** from an **end-entity certificate,** to a **root CA certificate,** ensuring authenticity every step of the way.  PKI applications enable secure communications on the web and on mobile devices.
