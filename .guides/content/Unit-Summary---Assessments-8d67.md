##       Unit Check In

 Symmetric key cryptography has been in use since ancient times. It has evolved from simple shift ciphers to substitution ciphers to mathematically complex block ciphers and stream ciphers like RC4. 
 
Not all shift ciphers go letter by letter. Block ciphers apply both a key and an algorithm to a block of plaintext, as evidenced in DES and AES.
