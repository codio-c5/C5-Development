Let's create an example key for a simple, monographic substitution cipher: `ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA`. In this example, it's just the alphabet reversed. A is now Z, B is Y, and so on.

If we use it to encrypt the message “Never say never,” we get this result:
`MVEVI HZB NVEVI` 

## On Your Own
Experiment with substitution ciphers on the left. For instance, copy the previous key `ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA` and paste it into the text box in the upper window. Alternatively, you can create your own key and enter it manually if you wish. (Duplicate characters will be removed and missing ones entered automatically.)

- On line 1, where you see "never say never," type "An apple a day keeps the doctor away."
- Click the `Encrypt` button.

{Encrypt}(substitution/subencrypt.sh)

- Click the `Decrypt` button.

{Decrypt}(substitution/subdecrypt.sh)
