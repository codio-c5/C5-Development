Let's create an example key for a simple, monographic substitution cipher: `ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA`. In this example, it's just the alphabet reversed. A is now Z, B is Y, and so on.

If we use it to encrypt the message “Never say never,” we get this result:
`MVEVI HZB MVEVI` 

- Before starting, click the `Cleanup` button.

{Cleanup}(substitution/cleanup.sh)

- Click the `Encrypt` button.

{Encrypt}(substitution/subencrypt.sh)

- Click the `Decrypt` button.

{Decrypt}(substitution/subdecrypt.sh)

## On Your Own
Experiment with substitution ciphers on the left. Create your own key and enter it manually if you wish. (Duplicate characters will be removed and missing ones entered automatically.)

- On line 1, where you see "never say never," type "An apple a day keeps the doctor away."
- Click the `Encrypt` button.

{Encrypt}(substitution/subencrypt.sh)

- Click the `Decrypt` button.

{Decrypt}(substitution/subdecrypt.sh)

Try encrypting and decrypting other phrases.
