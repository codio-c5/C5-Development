Let's create an example key for a simple, monoalphabetic substitution cipher: `ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA`. In this example, it's just the alphabet reversed. If we use it to encrypt the message “Never say never”.

we get the result

`MVEVI HZB NVEVI`

You can see that it maps "A" to "Z", "B" to "Y" , etc.  

## Your Turn
You can play with the substitution cipher on the left. Enter some text and press the Encrypt button and then the Decrypt button to get a feel for how a substitution cipher works.

{Encrypt with substitution cipher}(substitution/subencrypt.sh)

Now decrypt the ciphertext

{Decrypt with substitution cipher}(substitution/subdecrypt.sh)
