Let's create an example key for a simple, monoalphabetic substitution cipher: `ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA` It's just the alphabet reversed. If we use it to encrypt the message “Never say never” we get the result:

"MVEVI HZB NVEVI"

You can see that it maps "A" to "Z", "B" to "Y" , etc.  

## Your Turn
You can play with the substitution cipher on the left. Enter some text and press the Encrypt button and then the Decrypt button to get a feel for how a substitution cipher works.
