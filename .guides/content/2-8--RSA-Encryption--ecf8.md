In 1977, three researchers at the MIT Laboratory of Computer Science came up with the RSA Encryption algorithm. RSA was the first viable and publically available public key encryption algorithm [1] and  became the foundation for secure global communication unhindered by the necessity of explicit key distribution...

Today, the Internet as we know it exists because RSA made e-commerce possible. In other words RSA makes it possbile for 2 strangers to securely and confidently communicate with each other and that's the basis for conducting business over the 'Net.

Without a profit motive, the Internet would still be the sleepy domain of nerds, universities and the military that it was until the mid 1990's. When it was realized  money to be made, business started doing busines over the Internet. That led to more investment in the underlying infrastructure - fast fibre, data centers, software, devices, etc. Constant investment and innovation has let to the ubiquity and omniprecense of the Web [!=PC but oh well...]

And this was possible because (a^(p − 1)) − 1 is divisible by p, but only if p is a primate number and a is an integer not divisible by p.

This can also be expressed ad a^(m-1) ≡ 1(mod m).

Huh? That's Fermat's (Fair-ma) Little Theorem. He discovered that mathematical truth in 1640 and it says that the modulus m of a-to-the-m-minus-1 is congruent to 1. 

[Recall that 2 numbers are congruent if their only common divisor is 1.]

Ultimately, R, S and A discovered that by combining Fermat's Theorem, Euler's Totient Function, the Chiness Remainder Theorem, the Euclidean Algorithm and other mathematical wonders, that they could calculate two numbers that are the inverse of each other. That means that one number multiplied by the other equals 1. One number is used as the public key and the other the private key.

RSA brilliantly combines mathematics spanning centuries and, actually, millenia.  

mathematics devised in the 18th century. It uses Pierre de Fermat's (the t is silent) little theorem that concludes that it's impractical to find two primate numbers that when multiplied together produce a
