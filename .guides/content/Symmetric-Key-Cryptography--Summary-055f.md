### Symmetric key cryptography has been in use since ancient times, and has evolved from the simple shift ciphers to substitution ciphers to mathematically complex stream ciphers like RC4.  Not all shift ciphers go letter by letter. Block ciphers apply both a key and an algorithm to a block of plaintext, as evidenced in DES and AES.
