 The greatest flaw in symmetric key encryption is the secure distribution of a shared key. Getting the key to just the person you want,and no one else, is tricky over unsecured channels.

In this unit, you'll learn that the problem can be solved in two ways- through **public key encryption** (also known as **asymmetric encryption**) or by **key agreement algorithms.**
