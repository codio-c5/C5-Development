## How do you get a key safely into the right hands, and keep it from prying eyes? ##

Modern symmetric key algorithms are great! They are fast and secure when implemented correctly and keys are chosen properly. Sometimes implementation is tricky, especially with key distribution.

With a partner, explore creative ways of how you could share a key between yourselves at your institution.

*Remember:* 
-  You need a secure channel that makes it very difficult for the adversary to access the actual plaintext that is being transmitted.
-  The Internet is not secure!

Share your creative solution with another team.  Can you crack their system?  Can they crack yours?

||| **Instructor note:** Student answers might include: having a trusted carrier;  carrying and delivering the key in a locked case; and sharing a key over an untapped phone line, plus others.|||
