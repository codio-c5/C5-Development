Two Belgian cryptologists - Rijmen and Daemen -  created The Rijndael cipher in the late 1990s. (The is constructed from their concatenated names and pronounced Rain-Dahl). They submitted a subset of the algorithm to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which was conducting a search for a new encryption standard. NIST selected Rijndael as the new Advanced Encryption Standard in 2001 and now used extensively worldwide. It is gradually replacing DES and 3DES.
