## Calculate the Hashes for the File 

The pane on the left is showing an  HTML5 file hash calculator.  (There are a number of such calculators on the web.)  You can use this one to determine hash values for the file (the language pack) that you just downloaded.

- A few  lines below the green box, select the **MD5** and **SHA256** options. (Uncheck the other options.)
- Drag and drop the file you downloaded into the green box. The file's MD5 and SHA256 hash values will appear.
 - Enter the hash values below.

 - Go to the source web site for the file you downloaded: **[click here.](open_preview https://www.openoffice.org/download/index.html panel=0)** 

 - Notice that the site includes **links for MD5 and SHA256 hashes of the file.** Now proceed to the lab's next step, in which you'll download those hash values so that you can compare them to the hash values you calculated in this step.
