 - Go to the source web site for the file you downloaded: **[click here.](open_preview https://www.openoffice.org/download/index.html panel=0)** 

 - Notice that the site includes **links for MD5 and SHA256 hashes of the file.** Now proceed to the lab's next step, in which you'll download those hash values so that you can compare them to the hash values you calculated in this step.
