### What do you know about public key cryptography? As you know cryptography is the study of protecting information through the use of codes and ciphers. Cryptography forms a fundamental part of message security. In 1976, Whitfield Diffe and Martin Hellman created public key cryptography. Public key cryptography represents a major innovation because it fundamentally alters the process of encryption and decryption.

Cryptography is "the practice of study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversaries

It is the science of designing systems to store and transmit data in a secure way so that it preserves its integrity and is accessible to only those with proper authentication and authorization.

The main tenets of information security are confidentiality (encryption algorithms), Integrity (Hash functions), Authenticity Digital signaures, digital certificates), Non-repudiation (Digital signatures, digital certificates)
