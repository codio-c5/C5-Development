## Comparing and Contrasting Applications That Use PKI

Numerous applications use PKI  to support the things you do every day.  Some of the most well known include the following:

- SSH
- SSL/TLS
- IPSec
- VPN
- PGP
- Bluetooth Pairing and Communication Protocols

Research each of these applications on the Internet to answer the following questions:

- What does the acronym stand for?
- How is the application used?

**Instructor's Note:** As a Meetup, divide your class into groups and have each group take on one of the ciphers. Have the groups report back to the class at large with their findings.

**Answers:** 
**(SSH) Secure Shell** is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. It is used for remote logins.

**(SSL/TLS) Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS)** are widely used in web sites,  web browsers, internet email, instant messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP).  Largely, SSL has been replaced by TLS.

**(IPSec) Internet Protocol Security**  is a network protocol suite that authenticates and encrypts the packets of data sent over a network.  It supports application functionality including network-peer authentication, data-origin authentication, data integrity, and data confidentiality (encryption).

A **(VPN) Virtual Private Network**  is like a tunnel that connects systems across a public network as if they were on a private network. It is used in corporate intranets to connect remote users with internal network resources.

**(PGP) Pretty Good Privacy** PGP is used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications.

**Bluetooth Pairing and Communication Protocols** (no acronym) is a wireless communication standard for short-distance products like headphones, mobile phones, and personal area networks.
