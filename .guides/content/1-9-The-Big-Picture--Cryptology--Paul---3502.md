||| definition 
 Cryptology is a scientific field devoted to studying cryptography and cryptanalysis.
|||


- **Cryptography** focuses on designing systems to provide security. **Cryptology** is a field of cryptography. It focuses on the systems that keep information secret. **Cryptologists** create the algorithms and techniques that keep information safe.

- **Cryptanalysis** focuses on breaking these systems.
Cryptanalysis is also part of Cryptography. It studies crytographic ciphers with the aim of breaking or finding weaknesses that can have the potential of ultimately breaking a cipher. **Cryptanalysts** are people who seek to break a cipher. Today, we commonly call them **hackers.**

Earlier, we learned that Alan Turing was the cryptanalyst who broke the German Enigma system.
