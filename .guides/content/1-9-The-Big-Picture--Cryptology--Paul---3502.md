Cryptology is a scientific field devoted to studying Cryptograph and Crytanalysis.

- **Cryptography** focuses on designing systems to provide security
Cryptology is a field of Cryptography. It focuses on the systems that keep information secret. Cryptologists create the algorithms and techniques that keep information safe.

- **Crytanalysis** focuses on breaking these systems.
Cryptanalysis is also part of Cryptography. It studies crytographic cipheres with the aim of breaking or finding weaknesses that can have the potential of ultimately breaking a cipher.

Alan Turing was a cryptanalyst who broke the Germans' Enigma system
