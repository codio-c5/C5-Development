The Cryptanlyst can use this information to 
... This means that there is no cost penalty when trying to decrypt a message compared to what is spent encrypting it. Encryption ciphers should be very, very one-sided, meaning that the cost of surrupticiously decrypting a message should be much, much, much more expensive than the cost of encrypting. That requirement is what drives all of today's encryption methods.
